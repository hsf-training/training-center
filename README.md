# Training Center

[Click here for the deployed webpage](https://hsf-training.org)

## The project

There is a large number of training resources for newcomers in the field of High Energy Physics. The [HSF Training group](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/training.html) together with [IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org/) has started to compile a curriculum of such training modules that helps to get beginners up to speed quickly. However, the [current listing](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/training/curriculum.html) in the form of a static table is quickly becoming overwhelming, and we cannot include many resources because of space limitations.

This project is about creating a new training center that turns the static page into a dynamic list of training content that can be filtered by attributes such as programming language, common tasks, type of training, HEP experiment, etc.

## Run it

The website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

```bash
# once
npm install
# start a development server at http://localhost:4321/training-center/
npm run dev
# build the static website into dist/
npm run build
```

## Adding training material

All tutorials are listed in [`data/data.yaml`](data/data.yaml), and the curriculum
shown on the front page is defined in [`data/curricula.yaml`](data/curricula.yaml).
Images referenced by the `image` field go in [`src/images/`](src/images/).

Both files are validated when building the website (see
[`src/content.config.ts`](src/content.config.ts)), so typos in field names, invalid
values, missing images, or curriculum entries that don't match a tutorial `id` will
make the build fail with an error pointing to the problem.
